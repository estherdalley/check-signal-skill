## Check Signal
Check signal strength on IOTBit

## Description
Mycroft skill for checking the signal strength of a connected IOTBit.

## Examples
 - "How good is my signal?"
 - "What's the signal strength here?"

## Extras
 - IOTBit_library-auto needs to be moved to where Mycroft will look for it:
   For example, if you cloned mycroft-core into home/pi/:
         /home/pi/mycroft-core/.venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages
 - startMycroft.sh is designed to be run from home, as an easy way of starting
   the venv and cli-client during testing etc. - copy into home and edit paths
   necessary.
